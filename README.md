# FULLSTACKFROMSCRATCHATHON (and the CORSathon...)

This week we would like you to build a full stack app from scratch. Put your front end HTML/JS/CSS in `FrontEnd/` and create a new webapi in `BackEnd/` using the dotnet cli.

## Step 1 - What to build??

Brainstorm with your partner what you could build. Make it interesting but not too complicated!

Ask yourselves these questions...

- What data will we want to store in a database?
- What tables will we need?
- What routes will we want in our API?
- What will the front end look like?
- How will a user interact with the front end?

Once you have your idea, break it down to its simplest form and make a plan (and write that plan down!!) based on your answers to the above questions.

## Step 2 - Build!

Now that you have a plan (written down!!), it's time to execute. Start building the simplest version of your idea. Use all the things we've learnt during the course and put it together into something of your own design!

## CORS

When you connect the front end and backend, you will hit a CORS error. CORS stands for cross origin resource sharing, and is a restriction that means you have to allow requests to your api from domains other than the domain it is hosted on.
